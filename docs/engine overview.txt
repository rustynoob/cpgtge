Introduction:

    Welcome to this tutorial on the game engine!
    We'll be covering all the core systems and components of the engine, as well as how to set up a basic game.

Part 1: The Entity-Component-System Architecture:

    We'll start by explaining the Entity-Component-System architecture, which is the core structure of the game engine.
    We'll talk about how entities are the basic building blocks of the game, and how they can be extended with components to give them behavior and properties.
    We'll also cover how systems process the components of entities to update the game world.

Part 2: The Game Loop:

    Next, we'll go over the game loop, which is the heart of any game.
    We'll talk about how the game loop updates the game world and renders the game to the screen.
    We'll also cover how to use requestAnimationFrame to create a smooth, consistent frame rate.

Part 3: The Core Systems:

    In this section, we'll cover the core systems of the game engine, including the InputSystem, PhysicsSystem, and ParticleSystem.
    We'll explain how each system works and how to use them in your game.

Part 4: The Core Components:

    In this section, we'll cover the core components of the game engine, including the TransformComponent, CollisionComponent, and PhysicsComponent.
    We'll explain how each component works and how to use them to give your entities behavior and properties.

        Adding entities to the game

    Demonstrate how to create an entity and add it to the game using the game.addEntity method
    Show how to add components to an entity using the addComponent method
    Explain how to create custom components by subclassing the Component class
    Discuss how to access and update an entity's components using the getComponent and hasComponent methods

    Adding systems to the game

    Explain how to create a custom system by subclassing the System class
    Demonstrate how to add a system to the game using the game.addSystem method
    Show how to access and update entities within a system using the entities property and the update method
    Discuss how to use the priority property to control the order in which systems are updated

    Adding user input

    Show how to use the InputSystem to handle keyboard and touch events
    Demonstrate how to access the input state of the InputSystem using its class properties
    Explain how to add event listeners to the canvas element using the start method of the InputSystem

    Adding rendering and graphics

    Introduce the RenderSystem and explain how it is used to draw entities to the canvas
    Demonstrate how to add a SpriteComponent to an entity to specify which image should be drawn
    Show how to use the TransformComponent to control the position, scale, and rotation of an entity
    Explain how to use the CameraComponent to control the viewport and create a scrolling effect

    Adding physics and collision

    Introduce the PhysicsSystem and explain how it is used to update the velocities and positions of entities
    Demonstrate how to add a PhysicsComponent to an entity to specify its mass and initial velocity
    Show how to use the CollisionComponent to specify the dimensions of an entity and detect collisions
    Explain how to use the applyForce method of the PhysicsSystem to apply forces to entities

For the thumbnail, you could consider using a screenshot of a game made with the engine, or an image that represents the different features of the engine (such as a character sprite, a platform, and a particle effect). You could also consider using text on the thumbnail, such as the title of the video or a tagline like "Build Your Dream Game Today".
